```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
```

```{r, read in data}
workforce <- read_csv("workforce.csv")
```

```{r filter data}
workforce <- 
  workforce |>
  filter(month > "2019-12-31")
```

Here is a plot of the number of NHS employees in England since `r min(workforce$month)`. 

```{r}
ggplot(workforce, aes(x = month, y = total)) + 
  geom_point(colour = "blue") + 
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Headcount")
```
